.. _glossary-energy-performance:

- **energy performance**: the extent to which
  :ref:`end use demand <glossary-end-use-demand>` causes
  :ref:`energy demand <glossary-energy-demand>`. Higher performance
  indicates lower energy demand for *equivalent* end use demand. Sometimes
  referred to as :ref:`building performance <glossary-building-performance>`.


.. _glossary-energy-trace:

- **energy trace**: see :ref:`trace <glossary-trace>`


.. _glossary-gross-observed:

- **gross observed**: an estimate of
  :ref:`energy demand <glossary-energy-demand>` over the
  :ref:`reporting period <glossary-reporting-period>` as given by
  :ref:`baseline <glossary-baseline>` models and observed values from the
  reporting period.


.. _glossary-gross-predicted:

- **gross predicted**: an estimate of
  :ref:`energy demand <glossary-energy-demand>` as given by the
  :ref:`baseline <glossary-baseline>` and reporting models evaluated over the
  :ref:`reporting period <glossary-reporting-period>`.


.. _glossary-intervention:

- **intervention**: a set of upgrades or performance improvements on physical
  infrastructure of an existing building
  (see :ref:`retrofit <glossary-retrofit>`), or of behavior of individuals
  living in an existing building.


.. _glossary-modeling-period:

- **modeling period**: a period of time over which an
  :ref:`energy model <glossary-energy-model>` is to be created for a
  particular :ref:`trace <glossary-trace>`. This is a generalization of
  :ref:`baseline <glossary-baseline-period>` and
  :ref:`reporting <glossary-reporting-period>` periods. Modeling periods
  generally fall into one of those two categories.


.. _glossary-projected-baseline-energy-demand:

- **projected baseline energy demand**: a counterfactual estimate of
  :ref:`energy demand <glossary-energy-demand>` as it might have been under
  a particular :ref:`end use demand <glossary-end-use-demand>` scenario had an
  intervention not occurred.


.. _glossary-project:

- **project**: an :ref:`intervention <glossary-intervention>` or
  :ref:`retrofit <glossary-retrofit>` for which there is an expected change in
  :ref:`energy demand <glossary-energy-demand>`.


.. _glossary-reporting-period:

- **reporting period**: a time period after a
  :ref:`retrofit <glossary-retrofit>` of interest over which to model,
  observe, or estimate :ref:`energy performance <glossary-energy-performance>`.
  Generally used in reference to a
  :ref:`baseline period <glossary-baseline-period>`.


.. _glossary-retrofit:

- **retrofit**: a set of :ref:`interventions <glossary-intervention>` taking
  place at a particular building or site which modify pre-existing
  structures, installations or appliances.


.. _glossary-structural-change-model:

- **structural change model**: a model which takes tries to determine the
  most probably extents of :ref:`baseline <glossary-baseline-period>` and

  :ref:`project <glossary-project>` given its :ref:`trace <glossary-trace>`
  data.


.. _glossary-trace:

- **trace**: a single time series of measured values associated with units at
  a particular (not necessarily fixed) frequency.


.. _glossary-trace-interpretation:

- **trace interpretation**: the meaning of the trace data. Possible
  interpretations are outlined in :ref:`eemeter-structures`


.. _glossary-typical-meteorological-year-3:

- **Typical Meteorological Year 3 (TMY3)**: A set of
  `publicly available <http://rredc.nrel.gov/solar/old_data/nsrdb/1991-2005/tmy3/>`_
  :ref:`weather normals <glossary-weather-normal>` designed by the National
  Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL). Used by EEMeter for
  :ref:`weather normalization <glossary-weather-normalization>`.


.. _glossary-weather-normalization:

- **weather normalization**: a technique to account for differences in
  :ref:`end use demand <glossary-end-use-demand>` due to variations in weather
  patterns which uses a model of weather-dependent
  :ref:`energy demand <glossary-energy-demand>` to determine a counterfactual
  energy demand under a weather conditions described by a
  :ref:`weather normal <glossary-weather-normal>`.


.. _glossary-weather-normal:

- **weather normal**: a set of (not necessarily observed) weather data
  designed to reflect a "typical" weather scenario. Often covers a time
  period of 1 year. Used in
  :ref:`weather normalization <glossary-weather-normalization>`.
  See :ref:`TMY3 <glossary-typical-meteorological-year-3>`.

.. _glossary-zip-code-tabulation-area:

- **ZIP Code Tabulation Area (ZCTA)**: a set of geographical areas based on
  US Postal Service (USPS) ZIP codes, necessitated by the fact that ZIP codes
  do not map easily onto geographies. Built and maintained by the US Census
  Bureau. Contains only about three quarters of valid ZIP codes. ZIP code and
  ZCTA do not always match.
